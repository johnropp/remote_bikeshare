### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This is an application used to explore bikeshare data from three major metropolitan areas: Chicago, New York City, and Washington DC.

The application calculates basic univariate statistics on the filtered data and outputs the results for the user.

### Credits
This project was inspired by the Udacity Data Analytics with Python course.
I also credit reviewer 1 on my project for giving me helpful tips on how to better follow the Udacity Commit Messaging Style Guide.
